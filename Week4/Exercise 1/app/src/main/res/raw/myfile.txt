Moon looking bright tonight

Like trying to keep you alive

Alright

Just stay away from me

Let me down easily

You're too late

You're too late

Don't you pray

Don't you pray

Seeking for my embrace

Wanting my touch, begging me to stay

Every night and day

Calling my name, shout it still you break

You took my heart, Held it and ripped apart

Make me a prisoner, 

Got me going right under

Feelling that you feign? 

Fooling me again ...

No need to explane

God's helping me out

Get over my doubt

Thought I can't live without

Forget you right now

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

Making My Way

Making My Way

I wanna know the cure

For all that time you make me endure

All the words you say

Ought to keep your prey wwll and behaved

I reckon' it's time

Betting my luck on dimes

Taking new leap in 

Getting far away from your cheating

Seeking for my embrace

Wanting my touch, begging me to stay

Every night and day

Calling my name, shout it still you break

You took my heart, Held it and ripped it apart

Make me a prisoner,

Got me going right under

Feelling that you feign?

Fooling me again ...

No need to explain

Taking my own lane

God's helping me out

Get over my doubt

Thought I can't live without

Forget you right now

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

Making My Way

Making My Way

Telling me I''ll kill for you

Like a truth

With no proof

Never knew

WÃ¡ a doll, now the thing yiu pulled,

Never make me yield

Pin you down like a golden view

Right uphil

Make you dwell

What I feel

Wish you well

Living right in the kingdom I built a new

Draining tears and wallow in guilt
